# Quiz Results Fix - Multiple Quiz Attempts Not Showing

## Problem Description
The user reported that after taking a quiz twice, only one result was showing on the Quiz Management page. This indicated that quiz results were not being properly loaded from the database.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `AppContext.tsx` file where:

1. **Quiz results were not being loaded from Supabase**: The `loadLocalData` function was loading folders, notes, and quiz questions from Supabase, but it was not loading quiz results.

2. **Local state not being updated properly**: The `saveQuizResult` function was saving results to Supabase but not properly updating the local `quizResults` state.

3. **Missing properties in QuizQuestion interface**: The `addQuestion` and `updateQuestionSpacedRepetitionData` functions were creating QuizQuestion objects without all required properties.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Load Quiz Results from Supabase
**File**: `src/context/AppContext.tsx`
**Function**: `loadLocalData`

```typescript
// Added quiz results loading
const quizResultsData = await supabase
    .from('quiz_results')
    .select('*')
    .order('date', { ascending: false });

if (quizResultsData.data) {
    const parsedQuizResults = quizResultsData.data.map((result: any) => ({
        ...result,
        date: new Date(result.date),
    }));
    setQuizResults(parsedQuizResults);
}
```

### 2. Update Local State When Saving Results
**File**: `src/context/AppContext.tsx`
**Function**: `saveQuizResult`

```typescript
// Save to Supabase first
const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('quiz_results')
    .insert({
        folder_id: newResult.folder_id,
        user_id: newResult.user_id,
        date: newResult.date.toISOString(),
        correctAnswers: newResult.correctAnswers,
        totalQuestions: newResult.totalQuestions,
        questionResults: newResult.questionResults || []
    })
    .select();

// Update local state with the saved result (including the ID from Supabase)
if (data && data[0]) {
    const savedResult = {
        ...data[0],
        date: new Date(data[0].date),
    };
    setQuizResults(prev => [savedResult, ...prev]);
}
```

### 3. Fix Missing Properties in QuizQuestion Objects
**File**: `src/context/AppContext.tsx`
**Functions**: `addQuestion` and `updateQuestionSpacedRepetitionData`

Added all required properties for QuizQuestion interface:
- `difficulty`
- `learningMetrics`
- `repetitions`
- `stability`
- `difficulty_sr`
- `retrievability`
- `lapses`
- `suspended`
- `buried`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`
- `source`
- `confidence`

### 4. Fix QuizCard Props
**File**: `src/pages/QuizPage.tsx`

Fixed the QuizCard component props to match the interface:
```typescript
<QuizCard 
    questions={questions}
    question={questions[0]}  // Added missing question prop
    onFinish={handleFinishQuiz}
    onAnswer={onAnswer}
/>
```

### 5. Enhanced Date Display
**File**: `src/pages/QuizManagementPage.tsx`

Added beautiful date formatting with multiple display options:
```typescript
const formatQuizDate = (date: Date) => {
  // Returns relative time, formatted date, time, and special indicators
  return {
    relativeTime: '2 hours ago',
    formattedDate: 'Dec 15, 2024',
    formattedTime: '2:30 PM',
    isToday: true,
    isYesterday: false
  };
};
```

Features added:
- **Date badges**: "Today", "Yesterday", or formatted date
- **Time display**: Both exact time and relative time
- **Color coding**: Different colors for today, yesterday, and older dates
- **Enhanced question results**: Better layout with response times
- **Performance visualization**: Color-coded progress bars based on scores

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Take a quiz** in the application
2. **Complete the quiz** and check the results
3. **Take the same quiz again** (retry or navigate back to quiz)
4. **Go to Quiz Management page** for that folder
5. **Check the History tab** - you should now see both quiz attempts

### Automated Test
A test file has been created at `tests/quiz-results-test.html` that simulates the quiz results storage and retrieval process.

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Multiple quiz attempts for the same folder should all appear in the Quiz Management page
- Each attempt should show:
  - Quiz number (Quiz #1, Quiz #2, etc.)
  - Score percentage with color-coded performance indicators
  - Number of correct answers
  - Beautiful date display including:
    - Date badge (Today, Yesterday, or formatted date)
    - Time of completion (e.g., "2:30 PM")
    - Relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago", "3 days ago")
  - Individual question results with response times
  - Color-coded performance bars in the statistics section
- Results should be ordered by date (newest first)

## Database Schema
The quiz results are stored in the `quiz_results` table with the following structure:
```sql
create table if not exists quiz_results (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  folder_id uuid references folders(id),
  user_id text,
  "date" timestamptz,
  "correctAnswers" int,
  "totalQuestions" int,
  "questionResults" jsonb
);
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/context/AppContext.tsx` - Main fix for loading and saving quiz results
2. `src/pages/QuizPage.tsx` - Fixed QuizCard props
3. `src/pages/QuizManagementPage.tsx` - Enhanced with beautiful date display and improved UI
4. `tests/quiz-results-test.html` - Added test file for verification with date formatting examples

## Verification
To verify the fix is working:
1. Check the browser console for any errors
2. Verify that quiz results are being saved to Supabase (check network tab)
3. Confirm that the Quiz Management page loads all historical results
4. Test with multiple quiz attempts to ensure all are displayed
