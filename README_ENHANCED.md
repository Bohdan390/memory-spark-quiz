## 🎯 Enhanced Algorithm Details

### Content Analysis Engine
```typescript
interface ContentContext {
  keyTerms: { term: string; frequency: number; importance: number }[];
  concepts: { concept: string; definition: string; context: string }[];
  facts: { fact: string; context: string; type: 'numerical' | 'named' | 'temporal' }[];
  processes: { process: string; steps: string[]; context: string }[];
  relationships: { relationship: string; entities: string[]; type: string }[];
  mainTopics: string[];
  contentType: 'journal' | 'bookNotes' | 'business' | 'general';
}
```

### Question Generation Distribution
- **High-Relevance Fill-in-Blanks (30%)**: Uses most important terms
- **Concept Understanding (25%)**: Tests deeper comprehension
- **Fact-Based Questions (20%)**: Covers specific information
- **Process/Application (15%)**: Tests practical understanding
- **Multiple Choice (10%)**: Adds variety with smart distractors

### Quality Scoring System
Each question is scored across 5 dimensions with weighted importance:
- **Relevance (30%)**: Term importance + concept alignment
- **Variety (20%)**: Question type diversity bonuses
- **Difficulty (20%)**: Length + complexity + type weighting
- **Coverage (20%)**: Main topic alignment
- **Clarity (10%)**: Grammar + structure + positive indicators

## 📈 Performance Comparison

| Algorithm | Relevance | Difficulty | Variety | Clarity | Coverage | Overall |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------|---------|----------|---------|
