### Web Speech API
The feature uses the Web Speech API's `SpeechRecognition` interface:

```javascript
// Browser support check
const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
const isSupported = !!SpeechRecognition;
```

### Recognition Settings
```javascript
recognition.continuous = true;        // Auto-restart after pauses
recognition.interimResults = true;    // Show partial results
recognition.lang = 'en-US';          // Language setting
```

### Error Handling
The component handles various error scenarios:
- **No speech detected**: Prompts user to try again
- **Microphone not found**: Guides user to check microphone settings
- **Permission denied**: Explains how to allow microphone access
- **Network errors**: Suggests checking internet connection
- **Language not supported**: Recommends different language

## Integration Points

### Note Editor
The voice input is integrated into the note editor toolbar:
- **Compact button** with microphone icon
- **Settings popover** for configuration
- **Real-time status** indicators
- **Confidence scoring** display

### Accessibility
